## ‚≠ê Eric Sclafani ‚≠ê

[Computational linguistics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/) graduate turned fullstack .NET Developer currently employed at the **Kings County District Attorney's Office**.

Since I did a complete field switch from computational linguistics to web development, I have a lot to learn and am always working on side projects.

Currently, I am rebuilding my personal website in Angular. Check it out [here](https://github.com/eric-sclafani/website).

I have many more project ideas to try out so stay tuned üòâ
